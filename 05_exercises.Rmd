On the second day of the "Practical Statistics for the Life Sciences (2021)"
course, we will have four exercises on statistical, based on different
datasets:


# The captopril dataset:

The captopril dataset holds information on a small experiment with 15 patients
that have increased blood pressure values. More specifically, for each patient
we will have four values; one value for systolic blood pressure and one for
diastolyic, both before and after treating the patient with a drug named
captopril.

In this tutorial on data exploration, you will learn how to perform hypothesis
testing with data from paired experimental designs.

# The armpit dataset:

Smelly armpits are not caused by sweat, itself. The smell is caused by specific
micro-organisms belonging to the group of Corynebacterium spp. that metabolise
sweat. Another group of abundant bacteria are the Staphylococcus spp., which do
not metabolise sweat in smelly compounds.

The CMET-groep at Ghent University does research on transplanting the armpit
microbiome to help people with smelly armpits. To test the effect of
transplanting the microbiome, they conducted an experiment on two groups
of volunteers: one group was treated with a placebo, while the other had a
microbiome transplant. The goal was to assess whether a microbial transplant can affect the relative abundance Staphylococcus spp. in the microbiome of the armpit.

In this tutorial, you will use your acquired skills on hypothesis testing to
test if the microbial transplant has helped in decreasing the (average) relative
bundance Staphylococcus spp. in the microbiome of the armpit.

# The Cuckoo dataset:

The common cuckoo does not build its own nest: it prefers to lay its eggs in
another birds' nest. It is known, since 1892, that the type of cuckoo bird eggs
are different between different locations. In a study from 1940, it was shown
that cuckoos return to the same nesting area each year, and that they always
pick the same bird species to be a "foster parent" for their eggs.

Over the years, this has lead to the development of geographically determined
subspecies of cuckoos. These subspecies have evolved in such a way that their
eggs look as similar as possible as those of their foster parents.

The cuckoo dataset contains information on 120 Cuckoo eggs, obtained from
randomly selected "foster" nests. The researchers want to test if the type of
foster parent has an effect on the average length of the cuckoo eggs.

# The shrimps dataset

Dataset on the accumulation of PCBs (Polychlorinated biphenyls)
in the adipose tissue of shrimps. PCBs are often present in coolants, and are
know to accumulate easily in the adipose tissue of shrimps. In this experiment,
two groups of 18 samples (each 100 grams) of shrimps each were cultivated
in different conditions, one control condition and one condition
where the medium was poluted with PCBs.

The research question is; is there an effect of the growth condition on the PCB
concentration in the adipose tissue of shrimps?
